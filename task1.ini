The playbook is configured to run on hosts in the webserver group.
The hosts in the webserver group are web1 and web2.
Therefore, Ansible will install the httpd package on the hosts web1 and web2.
 The httpd package will not be installed on app1, app2, or app3, as these hosts are configured in the appserver group and the playbook installs tomcat on them instead.
